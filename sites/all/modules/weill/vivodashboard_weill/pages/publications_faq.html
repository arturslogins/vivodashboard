  <h3 id="1">What is the purpose of VIVO Dashboard?</h3>

  <p>VIVO Dashboard exists to allow faculty and administrators to answer questions about the publication record of academics at Weill Cornell Medicine.</p>

  <h3 id="2">What categories can I search, facet, or filter on?</h3>

  <p><em>Date Range:</em> Use the slide bar to set your desired date range, or click Past month to view the last 30 days worth of publications.</p>

  <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/date_range.png">

  <p><em>Publication Type:</em> Choose any combination of 20 publication types by clicking each check box.</p>

  <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/pub_type.png">

  <p><em>Journal Ranking:</em> SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) is an indication of a journal’s prestige. Similar to Impact Factor, SJR is calculated based on the number of times its papers are cited. However, it's different in that SJR is non-proprietary, and it uses a weighted citation score, meaning that citations from a prestigious journal are scored more highly than the less prestigious publications. In contrast, Impact Factor relies upon raw counts.  A <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/13304/1/Rousseau_Nanjing_conference_contribution.pdf">2009 analysis</a> computed a Pearson correlation of 0.873 when comparing SJR to Impact Factor.</p>

  <p><em>Journal Name:</em> As you type into the field, a list of possible matches will appear below.</p>

  <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/journal_name.png">

  <p><i>Author Name:</i> Search by first or last name; as you type, a list of possible matches will appear below.</p>

  <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/author_name.png">

  <p><i>Author's Person Type:</i> Limit by any of 20 person types by clicking one or more check boxes</p>

  <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/author_type.png">

  <p><i>Organization:</i> As you type into the field, a list of possible matches will appear below.</p>

  <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/Primary_Dept.png">

  <p><i>First/Last Author Affiliation:</i> Limiting here will only display records for which an active Weill Cornell academic is the lead or senior author. Some publications may be authored prior to a Weill Cornell appointment. For example, Professor Jones started at Weill Cornell in 2010. Selecting this option may include publications while she was at Mt. Sinai, at least in publications where she was first or last author.</p>

  <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/author_affil.png">

  <h3 id="3">How do I remove search filters?</h3>

  <p>All search criteria will appear in the <b>Current Filters</b> box. Click the <b>x</b> in front of a category to remove it, or click <b>Clear all</b> to remove all filters</p>

  <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/current_filters.png">

  <h3 id="4">How do I see the names of the publications in my search results?</h3>

  <p>Click <b>List</b> underneath the Publications tab to see a list of the publication names.</p>

  <h3 id="5">How do I save a search?</h3>

  <p>Just bookmark it in your browser! Every facet or filter you add is added to the web address.</p>

  <h3 id="6">How do I export search data?</h3>

  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click the <b>Export</b> tab.
      <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/export1.png"></li>
    <li>Click <b>CSV</b> or <b>DOC</b> (Word doc) to choose your desired format. Your screen view will change accordingly.
      <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/export2.png"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Download all items</b> to export your full search results <i>(NOTE: Click <b>Download # items</b> to export only the results currently shown).
      <img src="/profiles/vivodashboard/themes/vdb/images/faq/export1.png"></i></li>
  </ol></p>

  <h3 id="7">What is the source of the data?</h3>

  <p>The publication data is ultimately from the Medline and Scopus databases. VIVO Dashboard will harvest data from a locally maintained publication database (PubAdmin) on a daily basis. VIVO is maintained by Weill Cornell Medicine and the <a href="http://weill.cornell.edu/ctsc/">Clinical and Translational Science Center</a>. An <a href="http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/support#h.pxcl43nw2ftn">FAQ</a> contains more information on how these publications are identified.</p>

  <h3 id="8">What types of articles are included?</h3>

  <p>VIVO Dashboard contains all types of articles including academic articles, reviews, and editorials.</p>

  <h3 id="9">How comprehensive is VIVO Dashboard in terms of what it tracks?</h3>

  <p>VIVO Dashboard tracks all publications by Weill-employed full-time faculty. This includes those published at a previous affiliation.</p>

  <p>The Library aggressively matches publications where an author indicates an affiliation of Weill Cornell Medicine or Weill Cornell Graduate School. It most often includes publications authored by postdocs, fellows, and research associates. Sometimes the presence of a publication depends on whether a request is made to <a href="mailto:support@med.cornell.edu">support@med.cornell.edu</a>.</p>


  <h3 id="10">What's the difference between VIVO and VIVO Dashboard?</p> </h3>

    <p>VIVO is a profile system for active academics and will soon include PhD and MD-PhD students. VIVO Dashboard is a reporting tool that includes publications by the above as well as inactive people. They have an overlapping data model, but they are built on separate technologies.</p>


    <h3 id="11">How often is VIVO Dashboard updated?</h3>

    <p>VIVO Dashboard is updated daily.</p>

    <h3 id="12">If a department’s name has changed, will a search on the new departmental name include publications published by authors in the department before the name change?</h3>

    <p>No. If you want to include departments before and after the name change, you have to explicitly include both.</p>

    <h3 id="13">What can I do if a publication is missing or there is a problem with the site?</h3>

    <p>Contact the <a href="http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/support">VIVO Support Team</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="14">I am a developer. How can I make VIVO Dashboard available on my VIVO instance?</h3>

    <p>Please view the project’s <a href="http://github.com/wcmc-its/vivodashboard">Git Hub instance</a>. You may also contact Paul Albert at paa2013@med.cornell.edu.</p>
